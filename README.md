# 🤖 NAO Presentation Project

This project enables the NAO humanoid robot to autonomously deliver a scripted presentation and finish with a bow gesture, simulating a human-like talk show or demonstration.

---

## 📌 Features

- **Autonomous Presentation**: NAO delivers a pre-scripted presentation without human intervention.
- **Gesture Integration**: Includes a final bow gesture to close the talk.
- **Speech Synthesis**: Uses NAO's built-in text-to-speech system.
- **Choregraphe Integration**: Designed and executed using the Choregraphe graphical programming suite.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **NAOqi Framework** – For controlling NAO’s sensors, motors, and speech.
- **Choregraphe** – Block-based programming environment for NAO robots.
- **Python** – For behavior scripting and customization.

---

## 📁 Project Structure

- `Present.pml` – Choregraphe project file (behavior flow).
- `behavior_1/` – Folder with behavior scripts and resources.
- `manifest.xml` – Metadata describing the behavior package.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### ✅ Prerequisites

- NAO robot with NAOqi OS.
- Choregraphe installed on your machine.
- A network connection between your computer and NAO (Wi-Fi or Ethernet).

### 🧠 How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local system.
2. Open `Present.pml` in Choregraphe.
3. Connect to your NAO robot.
4. Deploy the behavior to NAO.
5. Run the behavior from Choregraphe or NAO’s onboard system.

## 🎯 Use Cases

- **Education** – Demonstrating robot behavior in lectures or workshops.
- **Events & Exhibitions** – Making NAO the star of your booth or demo.
- **Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)** – Exploring how humans respond to robotic presenters.
